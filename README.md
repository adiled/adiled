### Hello!

Don't mind that frown :point_left:, I'm facing the naked mountain :mountain_snow: (a.k.a killer mountain) there in western himalayas, it has that effect on you.. :sweat_smile:

For IPA nerds, I'm called ɑðɪl

I grew up hanging on trees :orangutan: and roller skating in a soviet-built suburb of an Asian megapolis.

:triumph: I was RTFM in '08, modding games, botting MMORPGs, hopped onto the design scene in '10, went fairly full-stack dev by '15 just when fancy UI frameworks were taking off, bootstrapped my first product startup in '18.

Lately I'm piecing together brilliant libraries :point_down: for some open-source goodness.

Looking to connect with like-minds building awesome productships.
